**Features**

- **Search Functionality:** The application provides a convenient search bar to find movies based on title. Leverage JavaScript libraries or APIs like OMDb API ([https://www.omdbapi.com/](https://www.omdbapi.com/)) to enhance search results.
- **Movie Details:** Each movie result displays comprehensive details: title, year, rating, genre, director, actors, plot summary, language, and awards.
- **Playlist Management:** Users can create and manage playlists to organize their favorite movies. Implement local storage or a database (e.g., Firebase) to persist playlists across sessions.
- **Sign Out:** Users can securely sign out of the application. (**Future Implementation**)  Integrate a user authentication system (e.g., Firebase Authentication) for future development.

**Future Enhancements**

- **Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow personalized movie recommendations and playlist synchronization across devices.
- **Movie Ratings:** Enable users to rate movies and view average ratings.
- **Genre-Based Filtering:** Allow users to filter movies by genre.
- **Interactive Elements:** Consider adding trailer playback, watchlist functionality, and social sharing options.
- **API Integration:** Explore using APIs like OMDb or TMDb ([https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/)) to retrieve richer movie data (posters, trailers, cast images).
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

**Deployment**

- Host the application on a web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Heroku) for public accessibility.
